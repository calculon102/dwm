# My dwm

My configured and patched version of [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org).

## Changes

* Set firefox to start on other monitor on tag 0
* Patched [noborder](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/noborder/)
* Patched [center](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/center/) and set pulsemixer to start centered
* Set font to Hack
* Added keybindings to favorite applications, lock-screen and shutdown
* Altered color-scheme to palette <https://colorhunt.co/palette/177052> - without pink
* Set border width to 3px
* Added xsessions-file, for offering dwm as option at login in display-managers

## Further ideas

* Bind keys to actions
	* suspend
