# My dwm-setup

This is my personal setup (technically fork) of [dwm](https://dwm.suckless.org).

## Changes

* Set firefox to start on other monitor on tag 0
* Patched [noborder](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/noborder/)
* Patched [center](https://dwm.suckless.org/patches/center/) and set pulsemixer to start centered

## TODOs

* Bind keys to popular apps
	* Firefox
	* Thunderbird
	* Steam
	* Spotify
	* htop
	* pulsemixer
	* (system monitor???)
	* Shutdown
* Checkout scratchpad-pad
* Is there a terminal calculator?
* Put xprofile under revision control
* Alter dwm colors
